# montyHall
Simple monte carlo of the famous Monty Hall gameshow.

The Monty Hall problem is based on a gameshow from the 70's where contestants played to win a car. Players would be shown 3 doors and told that behind one door was a car and behind the other two were goats.

The game:
The player would choose a door.

The host would then show the player a door that didn't have the car.

After this, the player would be given two options.
	1. Stay with either initial choice
	2. Switch their chooice to the other door.

The paradox behind this game is that the player has a 66% chance in winning if they switch their from first choice.

This monte carlo shows that.
